# Compiler
Replanted course project from my compiling class <br />
This compiler is designed for a programming language minidecaf, a subset of C, and is implemented in Python. The project performs syntactic and lexical analysis, and translate the programming language step by step to Abstract Syntax Tree, Three Address Code and finally RISCV Code.
